Fluid:
 - timestep calculation only works for Newtonian hydro

Integrators:
 - RiemannSolver() needs j and k as inputs
 - do we really need all of ivx, ivy, and ivz?
   - either ivx==IVX (and so ivy==IVY and ivz==IVZ)
     or ivx==IVY, ivy==IVZ, ivz==IVX
     or ivx==IVZ, ivy==IVX, ivz==IVY

Outputs:
 - add output of ghost zones 
 - add double precision option for vtk outputs
 - add proper line integrals in Sum transform
 - prim density different from cons density in relativity

Inputs:
 - how do we specify metric parameters (e.g. M and a=J/M)?
   - answer: add <problem> fields in input file
 - implement -d <directory> option?

Coordinates:
 - are arrays like face1_area_i_ big enough? seems like they should be nx1+2*NGHOST +1
   - answer: only using areas that border non-ghost cells, so this works as long as
     NGHOST >= 1
 - CellVolume(), Area1Face(), Area2Face(), Area3Face(): input il and iu should be
   calculable from which function is called:
   - CellVolume(): is -> ie
   - Area1Face(): is -> ie+1
   - Area2Face(): is -> ie
   - Area3Face(): is -> ie
   - Even future additions to code shouldn't care about areas and volumes in outer
     regions of ghost zones?

Mesh:
 - do we need to print is, ie, js, etc. at runtime?

Optimization:
 - const-ness of input int's can't be influencing code, can it?
