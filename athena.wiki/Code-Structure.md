(**_Note_:** *diagrams are from a version of code from July 2017 and are currently out of date*)


The organizational structure of Athena++ is diagrammed in the following documents:

- [[Object structure | presentations/athena_structure_objects.pdf]]: The relationships among all classes and structs in the code.
- Task dependencies and how the physical state is updated, cased out based on how the code is configured:
  - [[Hydrodynamics without mesh refinement | presentations/athena_structure_hydro.pdf]]
  - [[Hydrodynamics with mesh refinement | presentations/athena_structure_hydro_refinement.pdf]]
  - [[MHD without mesh refinement | presentations/athena_structure_mhd.pdf]]
  - [[MHD with mesh refinement | presentations/athena_structure_mhd_refinement.pdf]]
