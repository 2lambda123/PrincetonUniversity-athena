What is this:

This branch seeks to implement vertex centering (VC) for variable representation.
The prototype problem is the wave equation.


* What is to be done?

** Consistency conditions need to be completed for 3D.
** Prolongation operation for VC is bugged.
   This is most likely an issue during buffer packing.
** Buffer size should be computed carefully.
** I/O needs to be addressed.

* How to?

See auto_cvg_wave.sh together with scripts folder.

Note that a caching compiler with g++ is assumed to be used.
