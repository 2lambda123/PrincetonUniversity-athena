! comment start with '!', add reactions to each line, definitions see http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/help
! alpha, beta, gamma: coefficients of reaction rates
! F: the uncertainty factor on the rate coefficient
! g: the temperature dependence of the uncertainty factor F
! err: Type of uncertainty : lognormal (logn) , normal (norm) , loguniform (logu) , uniform (unif)
!
! itype: the type of reaction:
! 1: direct CR ionization/dissociation 
! 2: CR induced ionization/dissociation by UV photons emitted following H2 excitation.
! 3: FUV dissociation/ionization
! 4: Neutral-neutral (A + B → C + D), ion-neutral (A+ + B → C+ +D, A- + B → C- + D), anion-cation (A+ + B- → C + D) reactions and associative ionization (A + B → AB+ + e-)
! 5: Exchange reaction A+ + B → A + B+ and A+ + B- → A + B
! 6: Association reactions between two species (neutral or ionized) stabilized by the emission of a photon (A + B → AB + photon or A+ + B → AB+ + photon).
! 7: Association of a neutral species and an anion, resulting in the ejection of the extra electron (A- + B → AB + e-).
! 8: Recombination of a positive ion with an electron resulting in the dissociation of the molecule (AB+ + e- → A + B) or the emission of a photon
!    (AB+ + e- → AB + photon) or the attachment of the electron (A + e- → A- + photon)
! 9: grain assisted reactions (H2 formation, recombination)
! Tmin, Tmax: temperature range. When we do not have information on Trange, default values are used: -9999,9999.
!
! frml: formular for reaction rates:
! 1: Cosmic-ray ionization (direct and undirect)
! 2: Photo-dissociation (Draine)
! 3: Kooij 
! 4: ionpol1 
! 5: ionpol2 
! 6: Troe fall-off
! ID: the number of reaction, the special rates are also set by this ID
! ni: the number of (alpha, beta, gamma) in the downloaded network when several values are present in KIDA. 
!
! r: Recommendation is the recommendation given by experts in KIDA. 
! 0: the value is not recommended. 
! 1: means that there is no recommendation (experts have not looked at the data). 
! 2: means that the value has been validated by experts over the Trange
! 3: means that it is the recommended value over Trange.
! 4: other (set in code. alpha, beta and gamma are irrelevant in this case)
!
! only columns starts with "*" is used in our program, the temperature range is extrapolated.
